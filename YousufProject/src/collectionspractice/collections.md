**Introduction to Collections**
1. What is a Collection Framework?
      * Collection framework is an architecture that is used to store and manipulate 
    objects.Collection means a single unit of objects.
2. Explain Collection Heirarchy ?
3. ****Explain ArrayList****
 
Ans :
1. ArrayList is the implementation class of List Interface.
1. In ArrayList we can store duplicate elements also
1. In ArrayList we can store null values also.
1. The commonly used methods of ArrayList are add(),size(),remove(),get(),contains()
isEmpty()
   
    *Example Program*


4. Explain LinkedList
 
Ans :
1. LinkedList is the implementation class of List Interface.
1. In LinkedList we can store duplicate elements also
1. In LinkedList we can store null values also.
1. The commonly used methods of LinkedList are add(),size(),remove(),get(),push(),pop(),peek()
  


Q5.  **Vectors** 
1. ArrayList is not synchronized but Vector is synchronized

 
6) **How do you Iterate ArrayList**
1. Iterators are used to visit all the elements of a collection object
Thera are two types of iterators
   * Iterator
   * List Iterator
7) **Difference between Iterator and List Iterator**
Ans: 
   1. Iteratoor can be used with all the collection Objects
    2. But ListIterator can only be used with ArrayList,LinkedList,Stack and Vector
    1. Iterator moves in forward direction only but ListIterator can move in both the 
    directions.
       
8))Explain HashSet& LinkedHashSet
Ans : HashSet is the implementation class of Set Interface.
1. In HashSet we cant store duplicate values
2. In HashSet we can store null values
3. In HashSet we dont know the order of insertion
4. famous methods of HashSet are add(),size(),remove()
9))**Legacy classes**
   Ans : The classes which were introduced before java 1.5 version are called legacy 
   classes.
   Ex:Stack,Vector
