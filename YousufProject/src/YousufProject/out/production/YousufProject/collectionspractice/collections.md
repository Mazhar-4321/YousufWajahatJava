**Introduction to Collections**
1. What is a Collection Framework?
      * Collection framework is an architecture that is used to store and manipulate 
    objects.Collection means a single unit of objects.
2. Explain Collection Heirarchy ?
3. ****Explain ArrayList****
 
Ans :
1. ArrayList is the implementation class of List Interface.
1. In ArrayList we can store duplicate elements also
1. In ArrayList we can store null values also.
1. The commonly used methods of ArrayList are add(),size(),remove(),get(),contains()
isEmpty()
   
    *Example Program*


4. **Explain LinkedList**
 
Ans :
1. LinkedList is the implementation class of List Interface.
1. In LinkedList we can store duplicate elements also
1. In LinkedList we can store null values also.
1. The commonly used methods of LinkedList are add(),size(),remove(),get(),push(),pop(),peek()
  
Q5A) ** Differene between ArrayList and LinkedList
Ans : In ArrayList the datastructure used is "Dynamic Array" and in LinkedList the 
datastructure used is "DoublyLinkedList".Therefore search is faster in ArrayList whereas
in LinkedList insertion and deletion is faster.

Q5.  **Vectors vs ArrayList** 
1. ArrayList is not synchronized but Vector is synchronized

 
6) **How do you Iterate ArrayList**
1. Iterators are used to visit all the elements of a collection object
Thera are two types of iterators
   * Iterator
   * List Iterator
7) **Difference between Iterator and List Iterator**
Ans: 
   1. Iterator can be used with all the collection Objects
    2. But ListIterator can only be used with ArrayList,LinkedList,Stack and Vector
    1. Iterator moves in forward direction only but ListIterator can move in both the 
    directions.
       
8))**Explain HashSet& LinkedHashSet&TreeSet**
Ans : HashSet is the implementation class of Set Interface.
1. In HashSet we can't store duplicate values
2. In HashSet we can store null values
3. In HashSet we dont know the order of insertion,In LinkedHashSet elements are stored
   in the order we have inserted,In TreeSet elements are stored in sorted order&we cant 
   store null values in TreeSet
4. famous methods of HashSet are add(),size(),remove()

9))**Legacy classes**
   Ans : The classes which were introduced before java 1.5 version are called legacy 
   classes.
   Ex:Stack,Vector
10)) **HashMap,LinkedHashMap,TreeMap**
Ans : 
* HashMap :insertion order is random ,keys and values can be null
* LinkedHashMap : insertion order is preserved ,keys and values can be null 
* TreeMap : In TreeMap elements are stored in sorted key order and keys cant be null
but values can be null
