1. **Inheritance,types,benefits,cost,example program**
   
*Benefits*
* Reusability: We can define methods in parent class and all the child classes can
reuse those methods.
  
* Method Overriding : If we are not satisfied with Parent logic then we can create
our own logic using Method overriding and it is only possible using inheritance.
  
* Information Hiding : As we know we can only access public members of parent class,
if we want to hide some information from child classes then we have to declare parent
  class members as private.
  
* Reliability : Since parent methods are reused by all child cases , they are 
reliable because they are used many times and if any error occurs
  then it is easily caught.

1. **Does Java Support Multiple Inheritance(V.V.IMP)**

*It Depends*
* ******Multiple inheritance******: Multiple inheritance is a process in which an entity will
inherit from more than one parent (or) we can say an entity will have more than one
  parent (or) his mom has two husbands (or) extra marital affair (or) she is not
  muslim (or) she is having open relationship (or) she is a celebrity
  
* Multiple inheritance is not possible among classes but it is possible between class
and interface (or) interface and interface 
  
* a class can inherit from a class and an interface
* an interface can inherit from any number of interfaces

1. **Inheritance vs Composition (or) IS-A vs HAS-A relationship (or) In How many
ways we can access the members of a class**
