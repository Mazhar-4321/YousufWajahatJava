**Q) What is Inheritance? Explain different types of inheritance**

Ans: 

* Inheritance is a process in which we access public members of one class 
from another class.
* The class which donates members is called Parent class or Super class or Base class.
* The class which accepts members is called Child class or Sub class or Derived class.
* The class which act as both Parent and Child class at the same time is called Intermediate class.
* Types of Inheritance:
* 1)Single level Inheritance: If there is only one child class and one parent class then it is called as Single Level In
heritance.
* 2)Multi level Inheritance:If there is one child , one parent and atleast one intermediate class is called Multi 
level inheritance.
  
**Q) Explain the use of super and super() and super(...)?**

Ans : 
* super() : super() is used to access zero parameterized constructor of
parent class
  
* super(..): super(..) is used to access parameterized constructor of parent class.
Note : we cant give more than one super() or super(..)
* super : super keyword is used to access instance members of parent class.
* Note : super() or super(...) must be first statement.
